Description: This package can be used to investigate the relative signal
    timing of individuals engaged in a signaling interaction. Functions in this
    package calculate the observed amount of temporal overlap in a given
    interaction, and calculate the expected amount of overlap due to chance
    using resampling randomization techniques. These values are compared to
    determine whether individuals overlap significantly more or less often than
    expected by chance.
