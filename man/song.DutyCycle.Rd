\title{The duty cycle method for calculating chance overlap.}
\usage{
song.DutyCycle(indiv2, indiv1)
}
\arguments{
\item{indiv1,indiv2}{Lists created using \code{\link{song.BuildSongList}} or
\code{\link{song.ReadSongList}} that contain the performance statistics of
individuals 1 and 2 respectively.}
}
\value{
\code{song.DutyCycle} returns a list with class "\code{htest}"
containing the following components:
\describe{
  \item{\code{statistic}}{the value of the chi-squared test statistic.}
  \item{\code{parameter}}{the degrees of freedom of the approximate
  chi-squared distribution of the test statistic.}
  \item{\code{p.value}}{the p-value for the test.}
  \item{\code{method}}{a character string indicating the type of test
  performed.}
  \item{\code{data.name}}{a character string giving the names of the
  individuals included in the analysis.}
  \item{\code{observed}}{a numeric vector containing the observed number of
  overlapping and non-overlapping songs.}
  \item{\code{expected}}{a numeric vector containing the expected number of
  overlapping and non-overlapping songs.}
  \item{\code{residuals}}{the Pearson residuals, (\code{observed} -
  \code{expected}) / sqrt(\code{expected}).}
}
}
\description{
\code{song.DutyCycle} calculates the expected number of overlapping and
non-overlapping songs, then performs a chi-squared test to compare the
observed and expected values.
}
\details{
The duty cycle method was first described by Ficken, Ficken, and Hailman
(1974) in their study of acoustic interference in two avian species:
red-eyed vireos and least flycatchers.
