\title{Calculate the total duration of overlap.}
\usage{
song.TimeOverlap(target, reference)
}
\arguments{
\item{target,reference}{n x 2 matrices or data frames containing the start
and end times of n songs. The first columns contain the start times of each
song; the second columns contain the end times of each song. The amount of
overlap is calculated for the \code{target} with respect to the
\code{reference}.}
}
\value{
\code{song.TimeOverlap} returns the total duration of overlap in
seconds.
}
\description{
\code{song.TimeOverlap} calculates the total duration for which the songs in
one performance overlap the songs in another. A song is considered
overlapping if it begins while another song is in progress. This function
is an extension of \code{\link{song.OneSongWithSongList}}.
}

                     10.0, 11.0), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
