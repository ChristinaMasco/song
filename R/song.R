#' A data set containing the start and end times of each song produced during

#' playback stimulus. These data are from a study by Baker, Wilson and Mennill
#' (2013) designed to evaluate whether song overlap predicts the attack of a
#' rival in this species.

#' An interaction between a female rufous-and-white wren and her mate.
#'
#' A data set containing the start and end times of each song produced during
#' an interaction between a duetting pair of rufous-and-white wrens. These data
#' were collected using an 8-channel microphone array designed to passively
#' sample the natural duetting behavior of breeding partners as they move
#' around their territories (Mennill et al. 2006; Mennill & Vehrencamp 2008).

#' An interaction between neighboring pairs of long-tailed manakins.

#' A data set containing the start and end times of each song produced during
#' an interaction between neighboring male-male pairs of long-tailed manakins.
#' These data are from a study by Maynard, Ward, Doucet, and Mennill (2012)
#' designed to evaluate whether male-male pairs vary the timing of their duets
#' with respect to the duets of males in adjacent leks.
